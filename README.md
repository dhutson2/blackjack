How to play:

When cards are dealt, the player will get 2 face up cards and the dealer will get 1 face up and 1 face down card.
The player has the choice to either take another card, or stand (receive no more cards)
The player can continue to take new cards until their added card value is at or above 21
If the player stands, the dealer will take cards until their hand is at or above 17, or at or above 21.

How to win:

If when both turns are over the player card value is greater than the dealer card value, player wins
Otherwise if dealer card value is greater than players, the player loses.
