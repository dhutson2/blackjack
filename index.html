                    The Objective of Blackjack is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.<br>
                    If the dealer gets closer to 21 than the player, the dealer will win.<br>
                    The player can take as many cards as desired, one at a time, until 21 is reached or player stands.<br>
                    When the player ends turn (if cards are below 21), the dealer will play until at least 17 is reached or 21 is exceeded.<br>
                    If player wins hand, they get a point. Otherwise, they will lose a point.<br>
