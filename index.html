                        Fun fact: Blackjack is the casino card game that gives the player the highest odds of winning each hand<br>
                        <br>
                        Instructions: <br>
                        <br>
                        The Objective of Blackjack is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.<br>
                        If the dealer gets closer to 21 than the player, the dealer will win.<br>
                        <br>
                        Turns:<br>
                        <br>
                        Each turn consists of the option to either hit or stand.<br>
                        <br>
                            - Hit will add another card to hand, which will add to hand point total.<br>
                            - Stand will take no more turns and keep the current hand point value.<br>
                        <br>
                        The player can take as many turns as desired, one at a time, until 21 is reached, player stands, or player busts(goes over 21)<br>
                        <br>
                        How to win:<br>
                        <br>
                        When the player ends turn (if cards are below 21), the dealer will take a turn until at least 17 is reached or 21 is exceeded.<br>
                        If a player hits 21, they will win. Once turns are over, whoever has higher card between dealer and player wins.<br>
                        If both players finish taking turns and hand points are equal, it is a draw<br>
                        If player wins hand, they get a point. Otherwise, they will lose a point.<br>
