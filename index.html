                        Fun fact: Blackjack is the casino card game that gives the player the highest odds of winning each hand<br>
                        <br>
                        The Objective of Blackjack is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.<br>
                        If the dealer gets closer to 21 than the player, the dealer will win.<br>
                        The player can take as many cards as desired, one at a time, until 21 is reached or player stands.<br>
                        When the player ends turn (if cards are below 21), the dealer will play until at least 17 is reached or 21 is exceeded.<br>
                        If player wins hand, they get a point. Otherwise, they will lose a point.<br>
